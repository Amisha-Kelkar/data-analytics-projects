This project explores the impact of advertisement vibrancy and the inclusion of call-to-action (CTA) elements on consumer appeal and engagement. Through a randomized experiment with 66 respondents, participants were exposed to minimalist, vibrant, and vibrant-with-CTA print ads for six major brands. The study measured appeal ratings, likelihood to click, and demographic data to evaluate how design influences perception and behavior. Results showed that while vibrant ads moderately increased click likelihood, they did not significantly enhance appeal. Interestingly, adding a CTA did not consistently improve engagement and sometimes reduced ad attractiveness. Further analysis revealed that gender, age, and region influenced responses, emphasizing the importance of tailoring ad design to specific audiences. Methods used included t-tests, effect size analysis (Cohenâ€™s d), ATE/CATE calculations, and OLS regression, with demographic controls. Despite limitations like small sample size and self-reported behavior, the findings highlight the nuanced relationship between ad design and consumer response.
